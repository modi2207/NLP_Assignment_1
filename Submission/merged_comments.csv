0,0,jbnqqau,"Sorry, my answers are going to be short due to time constraint and I will try to answer the questions from my memory, so I apologise in advance for any inconsistency. I would have written a more detailed post with better citations if I had more time.

There are very few English sources you can use, most local written works about the period are in Dhivehi. I will try my best to point out some English sources you can use.

\> Muhammad Shamsuddeen Iskander III was arrested and deposed in 1934, but Hassan Nooraddeen II ascended the throne only in 1935 (and coronation happened much later in 1938) - who deposed Shamsuddeen and what happened in between?

Though the actual political infighting of the time is a bit convoluted, HCP Bell's Monograph have an excellent summary of the events which preceded his overthrow. Hassan Nooraddin  was the last hereditary Sultan of the Maldives from the Huraa Dynasty.  

There's a lot to say about how about the circumstances under which he was deposed, but it boils down to the political feud between the two leading families of the time; Kakaage and Athireege houses. 

 It's difficult to filter through the slander and propaganda, especially attacking the sexual orientation of the crown prince Hassan Izzuddin. TBH, I know more about the dead young prince and exiled grieving former Sultan from personal anecdotes given by my grandfather who lived during that period, rather than written historical documents. For most part of the 20th century Athireege family held political dominance in Maldives until the overthrow of president Amin Didi in 1953.

Shamsuddin was a political compromise for both parties, since he was related to Kakaage and was approved by the Athireege family. In return, Shamsuddin appointed the powerful patriarch of Athireege family, Ibrahim Doshimeyna Kilegefaanu as his prime minister. The real power of will be held by the descendants of this prime minister.

If you examine the 1932 constitution it had political purpose which reduced power of Sultan Shamsuddin and gave more power to the Athireege family. In short, Shamsuddin and later Hassan Nooraddin's overthrow was orchestrated by Athireege family for political reasons, to preserve their own power. 

BTW, while it's difficult to find written english sources surrounding the events, even Dhivehi sources are biased and avoid directly stating some vital fact because of the lasting effect of some of the people directly involved in the conspiracy, such as Abdul Majeed Didi (The absent King). 

If I get more time, I could post more details as a comment to this post.

\> While Maldives was a protectorate of the British, what were the local armed/police forces like in this period? At least the Sultan would surely have had some bodyguard troops.

The organisation of local militia changed rapidly throughout this period. Noble families had loyal group of men who functioned as servants and bodyguards, interchangeably who were called ""Aris Beykalun"" which I guess roughly translates to close-person. These servants were part of the noble's entourage and were often used in a variety of roles intimidation, political suppression and  sailors.

Historically, the local military of Maldives consisted of ""Hanguns"", the land militia and the naval militia had several different names over time. Honestly, I don't recall the names you should take a look at Bell's monograph, he would have written about it. This system might have pre-islamic origin. As for police, I think earliest equivalent will be ""Fenna"", details of which is also possibly documented in Bell's monograph. 

Before 18th century, there were periods of time where mercenaries were a vital part of the Maldivian royal military. However, Maldivians were more cautious and isolated until the end of the 20th century.

Most politically significant reform was in under Amin Didi, who created a proper modern uniformed militia force stationed in ""Bandeyrige"" which effectively laid foundation of the group that would be the predecessor of modern Police and Defence force. 

\> Was there any major religious authority in Maldives? For example, any religious body in control of major mosques like Malé Hukuru Miskiy?

For centuries religious authority is controlled by the chief justice under the name of Sultan. This system survived into the second republic until the ""Islamic Ministry"" was created and religious authority was transferred to that body.

I think the most influential religious figure of this period was Hussein Salahuddin. He was the chief justice of this period and later held several other positions. His works laid the foundation of the current Maldivian religious nationalism.

\> Any major WW2 related development other than these

Yes, Port T played a vital role in the Indian Ocean Raid of 1942. Port T included the whole of Addu Atoll, not just RAF Gan. I would recommend you to read Peter Dolling's book or talk to an RAF veteran who served later.

Admiral Somerville was there while the Ceylon was being bombarded and there was a planned counter attack. However, no contact was made and if I recall correctly, the Japanese never found the base until the end of March.

After the raid the port saw several minor actions, however the most noteworthy is the sinking of ""British Loyalty"", an oil tanker. It's noteworthy because of the impressive torpedo shot taken by german submarine, which managed to pass the torpedo net and the coral barriers. If you're not familiar with the geography, islands in the Maldives are surrounded by natural coral reef barrier which serves as a suitable natural defence against submarines and large ships.

There is a facebook group where veterans of RAF gan hangs out, but most are from post world war 1950s-1970s servicemen who were stationed there after the base was rebuilt. They might have something to add.

A personal anecdote I would like to add, my grandfather used to say that when the artillery guns fired the chain of Islands shook like an earthquake. It was terrifying.

 \> 5. Any other important political, military, or religious figures or events during the 1930's and 1940's.

A lot happened throughout the period, but I'm not sure what events will be relevant for a game. For instance, there were food shortages, cholera and other disease outbreaks and radical changes in the social system.

The defacto ruler of Maldives was killed when a torpedo from a german U-boat hit HMS Maaløy. Another key event is the Japanese uboat attack on the Maldivian merchant ship 'Fathuhul Mubarik', locally known as Yaahun baras. There were only two survivors of the incident who were captured by the Japanese for the remainder of the war. We don't exactly know how much the Japanese knew about Port T from the interrogation, but at that point in time I do not think it would have mattered

The event is important in local context, it affected the public sentiment and people were taken aback by the brutality of the Japanese navy that it made it into local folklore. You can find a version of the story in Xavier Romero-Frias collection of local folk stories.

Since it's a game; key people who you need to know will be Amin Didi and prince Hassan Farid Didi the two cousins who actually controlled Maldives. After the death of Hassan Farid Didi , Maldives was effectively ruled by Amin Didi alone for 10 years. There was also a brief one year transition into a republic under Amin Didi's attempts. Most leading politicians of this generation, including Shamsuddin's son prince Izzuddin were british educated and worked to modernize Maldives.

  
I might have some photographs and relevant documents possibly from the declassified archives. I can link it here  in an edits if it is relevant to you and if it's not against this subreddit's rule.

The most prominent source for general Maldivian history is Xavier Romero-Frias, Clarence Maloney and HCP Bell.

In the meantime, will try to process all of the info you have shared.

I worked in the reservations department at the four seasons so our work hours were fixed unlike most of the other staff at the resort. I would usually wrap up by 4 every day and be in the water either kayaking or snorkeling. On my days off I went with the resident marine biologist to hanifaru bay of wherever else he went and basically assisted. At night after dinner chilled at the lounge playing pool or video games.

This was my first job out of high school so I was very excited and participated in every single thing I could. Most of the older colleagues just ate and watched movies and talked to their loved ones on the phone. So I guess if you’re doing only those things you could go crazy after a few months.

14,14,jpylkyf,Pay was alright but this was 2010-2011 and it was the four seasons. The food was amazing since it’s cheaper for the resorts to buy the same ingredients as the guests in bulk. But it’s a fixed menu that rotates each week so after a few weeks some people do get bored. And yes the food is free at the staff restaurant. I have a few friends that worked in not so fancy resorts that didn’t have as good an experience so I guess it really depends on where you go. If you have an open mind I’m sure you’ll find ways to make the most out of your stay.,4,2,2023-06-29 06:02:56 UTC,0,islandtravel,14lfnpf,t1_jpykw0a,544,False,False,maldives

For one thing let me talk about the general public for a moment. Even though we call ourselves a Republic I do not believe our collective consciousness has truly embraced or understood the idea of a Republic or a Democracy. 

And this is ingrained on a cultural level starting from the royalty and the psuedo democracy that replaced that with beyfulhun's. Let us take a look at our language for one thing. In democracies we have leaders, not rulers. But to us we have only verin. Verin is the word for rulers, leaders and even owners. I am the verimeeha of the property I own. I should not be the verimeeha of people I am meant to lead.

And this mentality can be seen when you really think about it. We elect people, but then have this expectation that if the president/minister etc wants something to happen that should happen. That if you have a problem they should immediately be able to fix it by telling people to do so. And are upset when that does not happen. But that's not how democracies or leaderships work. That is how rulers rule. 

And then we have all these councils and commissions, where by law the president of such does not have an exceedingly great authority over the rest of its members. They are meant to work as a group, with the president leading and been the focal point. But what ends up is this culture of verimeeha makes the whole thing into whatever he/she wants happens. 

Ofcourse I do not really believe this is the general public's fault. It's just our ingrained culture we have yet been unable to change.",1,1,2023-07-15 17:33:04 UTC,0,crimson_solace,14z6nnb,t1_js0l0pi,1639,False,False,maldives

I have been renting my whole life, but I am the kind of person who tries to bring even an empty bottle home so that I can put it in my dustbin. I also dis-agree that people don't litter in their own houses, you will be surprised at just how filthy some places are.

I think it's mainly a matter of the collective culture, and also a bit of the broken window theory from sociology. Which states that existing signs of anti social behavior encourages further anti-social behavior. 

The idea here being that litter/dirt attracts more dirt. Even I have been guilty of this sometimes. If I see a pile of rubbish on the street it is easy to think my additional bottle or tissue paper won't make a difference. And this is also kind of apparent if you go to a lot of islands outside the greater male' area. Where you have garbage free beaches or streets. They still litter there to an extent too. But people will rarely want to be the first guy to spoil a pristine beach or street, so they will chuck it into the trees XD (which is still bad and where the idea of littering being culturally acceptable comes in)

And of course another issue is the lack of public bins. In like most other countries I have been in, you can easily find public bins to put in simple garbage like wrappers or bottles, but not here. And there is a reason for this too. When that was tried it was either destroyed or people just dumb in household waste that rots and destroys or just stuff they don't want to take to the dump. So again culture playing in.

We definitely do need to punish people who litter. Properly punishing, and enforcing such punishments and yes even shaming people for littering definitely would go a long way towards changing this culture. Those that don't litter in their own houses but do in public, do so because at home they will face consequences. Been forced to clean up or been yelled at by those who have to clean up after them. Whereas if you face no consequences for doing it in public they will just keep doing it.",9,0,2023-07-21 04:45:08 UTC,0,crimson_solace,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,2115,False,False,maldives

2,2,jsuh2i0,"Personally, I have never been someone who litters, so I never really understood why anyone could litter. However, I did read a lot about it, and like it was mentioned in a previous comment, your theory could be one of the factors. 

A lack of bins is also certainly comtributing factor. This issue mostly ties in with city planning I suppose. Finding public waste disposal areas in the Malé and Hulhumalé certainly is quite the task. 

However, some people just choose to litter even when bins are nearby. Again, as mentioned in a previous comment, littering has become so prevalent in our society that we feel our own littering won't contribute much to the issue. Or some people probably just don't care about it. 

Like you mentioned, passing legislature regarding littering and proper enforcement could encourage people not to litter. We tend to pass a lot of bills and introduce a lot of new laws here, but the laws are usually not enforced very well. So, there's that as well. 

I also think that we can incentivize not littering by rewarding people who don't litter. Like how some countries pay a certain amount of money when you return plastic bottles and other waste products.",3,0,2023-07-21 09:44:57 UTC,0,CarelessNightingale,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,1184,False,False,maldives

This sub has been around for a very long time. It has never had rules about maldivians posting about maldivian issues. It just so happened that only tourists posted on it. That is not the mods fault.

And now that this sub has become a bit more active what...we are calling for isthiufa? How very....maldivian. 

That said given that the dynamic of this subreddit is changing perhaps the mods can take it into consideration and implement some changes and they are active. I have seen them ban or warn people of personal adverts and even engage in the comments of recent posts. And also do seem to be maldivian based on their post history.

Perhaps you could add that stuff back on a tentative basis too. See how it goes and whether it's too much for you guys as mods. If doing so I think you should make it clear in a post that you guys are trying things out and changes may again need to be made in the future.

Recently tried KFZ- korean food zone  at hulhumale.  It is run by a Korean lady. Cute personality and creates the vibe and feel of a Korean place. And the food is authentic  . Thou might be just slightly a little high end on the pricing. It is worth for the experience.


As for symphony and  Italian dishes. Hmmm well they are too Maldivianized. At this point.  Yeah I understand cannot serve most Italian dishes due to halal. But can keep to the concept the theme of the original dish. 
For instance carbonara base of the dish is 
- Cured pork cheeks /pancetta 
- egg/egg yolks 
- parmesan/ pecorino

So why not just replace the cured meat with a halal beef based cured meat. Still this will not change the base of the dish. Which is even a served variant  in Italy to ppl who eat halal.

But here mostly it's take aways the eggs. Adds cream/ milk, Bell pepper. Cheddar cheese. Cream cheese parsley leafs . It is all a mushy mess.

1. Final Fantasy VI
2. The Sims
3. Mass effect series (- not Andromeda, that's garbage)
4. Super Metroid
5. Castlevania 
6. Fire Emblem any of the GBA games
7. Mother / Earthbound series.
8. Tetris
9. X-Com
10. Elder Scrolls (any game in this series holds up)

I picked ff6, because I played all final fantasy titles progressively till 10 and it is really the best one. Along with Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Lufia II it's probably the best jrpg of it's time. 

Mass effect, because it has a decent story and good space opera. 

Castlevania and Metroid, has the best gameplay ever designed. Discovered Super Metroid when I wrote a paper on it (about symbolism and narrative) for college assignment (also portal and ""To the moon""), it has a good replay value. 

Fire Emblem; I played to pass time when commuting.
X-COM and battle toad whenever I wanted something challenging, I hate contra and metal slug is way easy.

Tetris, hard to believe for some but probably the best game ever made. I used to write tetris and snake in every new language, emulator or platform I work on. Even wrote one for ""z80lives"", my old partially complete but abandoned z80 based computer emulator suite.  Ironically it's name ""lives"" on as my internet handle.

6,6,jv959n4,"As a thalassemic patient myself. As in not a career but someone who has to take regular transfusions, my answer to this has always been don't break up JUST because of that. It is a controversial opinion yes and people usually disagree with me on this.  


First let me just give you the obvious options of adopting or as mentioned here the genetic engineering IVF avenues if you have the money. Though I am not 100% sure how viable that is. You should do a bit more research on that. But if any of those are an option for you, then I mean you have no issues right?  
On the issue of having an actual thalasemic child, here is how I see things. Even thalassemia aside life has no guarantees. You could get a child who requires some special care in another form. Yes marrying as career's raises that risk, but in a sense, it also gives you the chance to consider whether that is something both of you can face as a couple. There is a quote I quite like, It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease, than to know what sort of disease a person has. Here it is what sort of person you are that would matter. Even today due to lack of awareness a lot of people will see thalasemic's as sick. Sick in the sense they are weak and cannot do everything normal people does. But that is not true at all, with proper treatment, there are thalasemic's doing all sort of things. One even goes bodu kahneli fishing ah. As you know that is a very physically demanding job.  


What is most important to understand is that it's going to be physically, mentally and financially draining. Especially when the child is young and don't understand things, you are going to have to force them to take the proper treatment. They will cry and fight against it, and you will have to be strong enough to deal with that. And while there are now tablet medications that can be used, most thalasemic's still take medication through a syringe and a pump that has to be on them throughout the night on most nights. When I was doing thing it meant sacrificing evenings because I did not want to go out like that. But there are many that do. And if you can afford it there are small easy to carry pumps as well.  


Which comes to the financial aspect. Do not think that the government will take care of everything, so you don't have to worry. For one thing sometimes you have to spend for better quality of life than government provides. And while a lot of tests and stuff can be done here now, you must consider that sometimes you may have to go abroad, and even with all the social protection that is still quite a hassle, and can be financially burdensome. And then there is the whole thing of further studies like degrees and stuff. If the kid wants to go abroad for studies, unless in very rare circumstances you are going to have to foot the bill of their treatment, the government will not cover that. I faced this in my own studies.  


So I suppose the bottom line is can you handle all this, both financially, and as a couple. And the whole issue of putting your child through all this. Well that is a very difficult thing to answer and I suppose would depend on the kind of kid he/she turns out to be. I rarely if ever felt like bad for been a thalasemic. That would be a combination of my parents plus my own personality, so ofcours mileage is going to vary. But I think been a strong example for your child, and not treating them as like weak and sick will go far.  


If you have any people who you trust and knows the both of you well and will be honest with you talk to them. Ask for their honest opinion even if it will hurt you, see if they think you can handle all this, and your marriage will survive it. Think about it all on your own, then make the decision you think would be best for you.",1,0,2023-08-08 03:26:52 UTC,7,crimson_solace,15kluod,t3_15kluod,3797,False,False,maldives

And you have honestly highlighted my major issue. There are many other things that are passed genetically and can be screened for. But you rarely if ever hear someone saying about screening for those (yes I know you just did). There definitely isn't a systematic mandate in place to screen for anything other than thalassemia. And you certainly don't hear about people breaking up because they might pass on other genetic issues. It's only thalassemia that seems to be this significant medical diagnosis that is a cruel burden on the children. And that creates a very bad and untruthful impression about thalassemic patients on the general public as well on the patients themselves.

And while I am fully for screening embryos and choosing the best one, where does genetic screening when choosing partners lead? There are so many genetic conditions. Are we going to say some are ok and others are not? What someone thinks as significant will also differ from person to person. Are we going to avoid everything? At that point we might as well just upload our dna profiles and make matches based on just that.

Personally, I don't think state should ever be involved in religion.


Maldives is a monoethnic nation - like Malays of Malaysia - we seem to have infused cultural and religious identity. So I don't think state hold on religion will go away anytime soon.

We also have this religious nationalism formed not long ago and more recently a pan Islamic identity (btw, modern salafi movement also falls under Islamic modernism).

>What about allowing expats to construct places of worship?

Funny that's it's now a touchy subject for a lot of people. We had a chapel in Addu for the british and it was not that controversial back then.

It's important to improve the human rights and living conditions of the expats and freely practicing their own religion on their personal space is part of that. 

We probably should not let anyone build any type of public place for worshipping, just look at king salman mosque here in Malé.

And as long as these people in power stay in these high places of power influencing Muslims and non-Muslims with their bigotry; Islam will continue to get a bad name. 

And it’s not just about Islam, Hinduism is also going through this turmoil. Just look at what’s happening in India where far right Hindu fanatics have hijacked the Hindu religion and created a Jihadi version of it. 

Even in Christianity, the rise of intolerant right wing and far right practitioners has given rise to right wing dictators and politicians to power. 

Fortunately, the younger generation of Maldives are mostly liberal with a broad mindset so I feel this bad interpretation of Islam will eventually change when the old generation dies along with these bigoted mindsets.

27,27,jw7vj5g,">It seems that the king then asked the whole country to convert into Islam. 
>Maldivian Islam seems to have that dictatorial flavour since origin. 

Yes, true but it's a myth that the whole country converted in 1153 when ""Dharumavantha"" (likely Sri Thirubhuvana Aditya) converted. We know from written evidence (e.g. Kudahuvadhoo loamaafaanu) that it took atleast a century to form a very syncretic version of local Islam. Scarce documents we have from the period shows that early form of Islam would be unrecognizable to a modern Maldivian. 

Since then over last 7 centuries a lot happened. Neither religion nor culture ever remained static. Islam like any other religion was a dictatorial tool at times, other times it was a tool used  by the lesser nobles and commoners to popularize and weaken the influence of the rulers. There were times Islam was used as an excuse to justify oppression and slavery, but there were also times when it was invoked for egalitarian purpose like ending oppression and slavery (e.g. King Moheydin and Chief Judge Tajjudin). Like any political tool, how religion is used depends on whomever is wielding it.

 Over the centuries we also had kings who tried to impose their version of Islam, Christianity or whatever version of 'Shariah' that was prevalent in that century. As you may know very few succeeded. Some killed their opposition, destroyed old mosques and defunct monastaries, rebuilt mosques that they deemed suitable. Take for example, Sri Rajeswaran(13thCE), Haji Hassan (15thCE) and Mohamed of Dhevadhoo (18thCE); all religious despots who used Islam as a tool but practiced entirely different forms of the faith that would contradict the others.

However, taking account of 800 years of written history very few rulers were actual theocrats. Majority of rulers operated by their own interest not out of spirituality or religion.


>Wasn’t the king then converted by Arabic traders etc to Islam

 This simplified explanation is likely the case for most of the muslim majority places in ""Maritime silk road"", but it's actually more complicated in each case. Also, often ""Arab traders"" were neither arab or not even muslim. Other than religious commodities such as charms, books and artifacts; designs, ideas and architecture from the middle east were exchanged during this period and Islam was just a part of it.

 As we know in Maldives, there were a lot of Sufi proselyters but earliest person we can date is from 13th century. We're  not exactly sure why most of the Vajrayana Buddhist cultures in this route converted to Islam, but there is a hypothesis[1] that it have more to do with the spells, charms and relics the 'Arab' traders were trading. There is also the fact that the religious practices were very much localized by caste or was exclusive to groups, so it fostered an environment for religious syncretism. Unlike parts of North East India and South East Asia, we are not entirely sure about how things were in the Maldives.

However the most likely motivation for adopting Islam in the Maldives may have been political or economic reasons. After all, one of the earliest written records from 12th century is actually property endowment and tax decrees issued by the kings. Based on these documents we know that there seem to have been a radical powershift within the existing system. Conversely, it could have been Islam that triggered this powershift rather than the other way around.

For example, Isdhoo loamaafaanu (~1193ce) by Sri Gagana Aditya documents the execution of monks who opposed the royal order to convert, destruction of their monastaries but then focusing more on abolition of old taxes imposed by previous non-muslim kings and dues for certain influential families.

Flimsy? You mean Tarikh specifically, or just the few documents we have laying around?

😂 Yeah, I agree Tarikh manuscripts are biased. After all they all serve a political purpose for Hassan Tajuddin and his family who was very much involved with the events they're talking about. Other than that the first hand records we have from different periods are as close as you can get in terms of historical veracity.


> But yeah sure let’s just get rid of more than 850 years of social coherence

I think my point was to imply we didn't have that religious coherance for 850 years. Tajuddin himself was part of the Sufi Qadiriyya sect which were at first persecuted.

60,60,jw8ql2z,"""It seems that the king then asked the whole country to convert into Islam. Maldivian Islam seems to have that dictatorial flavour since origin.""

I disagree with this. In my opinion, even if we tolerated certain leaders, Maldives was never dictatorial in its essence. And certainly not in terms of religion. Our leaders were always good to their people, even if they were despots and sometimes despised their immediate family. But I think Islam and the power it held in politics was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III when the first constitution was written. The Maldivian identified first as a Muslim. Go ahead and read any speech given in public for the last 50 years.  I think the issue is more complex when it comes to sovereignty.

There's a dialogue here posted by the OP and I was referring to that. And I wasn't making a point against you. But expressly agree with you. History itself is not questionable but historians and their perspectives. And who's to say that there wasn't support for the conversion? The reason that it took many years only goes to show that there was a lot happening. And even if the population converted fearing reprisals, why is this harsher than when the Mayan villages were wiped out by the Spanish? And if we had mass killings there must be mass graves. Besides there was very little incentive to force anything on Maldivians. If Bell's descriptions were right, we are gullible people easily swayed (although fiercely nationalistic) up until we found our footing in more modern times. I would say specifically around Nasir's rule.

The 'historical context' (800 plus years) that I referred to was in terms of sovereignty, nothing else. This debate is about a point in our constitution. But consider this, we haven't had the death sentence in our country except in one previous case and now once again recently If I'm not mistaken. It has never been carried out in modern times. I think that's a sign of cautiousness. And when it comes to letting people practice out in the open we should at least consider our identity,  in spite of history. 'You cut off a people from their history and you cut off their roots.'

It's not just the case of Sanyal, but a few more Indian writers, who wish to have a more central, India-dominant narrative with account to history for the benefit of their technocrat class (I actually think Sanjeev Sanyal has a better grasp of Indian Ocean Histories than most).  And I see no problem with that. They are struggling with the same issues and the current government is aggressively Hindu (India still is very much caste-based by the way, you can see that even in their writing).  And don't even get me started on the bourgeoise classes (still existing) in the West, in spite of the views and warnings of philosophers such as Chomsky, and theorists like Gladwell and Alain de Botton. And the self-made techno-elite (Bill Gates).It's fine to apply modernist thinking from the comfort of a cushioned bed, but let's not forget, there are two main narratives in Maldives. That of an  'elite landowner class', who think that they should be able to enjoy the pleasures of a more hedonistic lifestyle. Even if that means controlling their landowner status at the cost of social unrest. And that of the more common person, who still identifies with their culture and the need to make ends meet. When it comes to the institutions and laws, I think it's better left to the latter. And that in theory is the state. Our state as far as the law rules until now, is one religion. And in a country as small as Maldives, I think that's a good thing (that is my opinion, in spite of coming across as being sarcastic, which I'm not irl). I also think it's a good thing that we are open to creating more opportunities and jobs, and a healthier expat community. And no, I don't think it's a good thing that we take advantage of them. But when it comes to 'allowing' other religions. That's a technicality in the law. Nobody is forcing Islam on others in the Maldives (unlike what some people here think). If you identify as non-muslim. That's your concern. But as per law, yes. You can't be a non-Muslim and be a Maldivian. That can only be changed by law right now. And even if that is changed in my opinion right now one religion is what will work in the Maldives. I can be proven wrong.

>was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III

We don't call him Iskandar III, that's not his name and we also don't number our sultans like the British. Sultan Shamsuddin Iskander III is the third king with Shamsuddin name. First was the foreign king, other uncle of dhon bandaara who built kallhu vakaru miskiy and then him. Maldivian sultan's reignal name usually have an identifier to distinguish other than the biruda and full arabic title we get. For example, Dhiyamigili Ibrahim rasgefaanu would be Ibrahim Iskander II and only Iskander rasgefaanu in any context would mean Utheemi Ibrahim Iskander I. Imadduddin II, III and IV is known to Maldivians by 'Muzaffar', 'Mukarram' and 'Muskulhi' prefix other than their local names. 

P.S I guess we have similar political leanings.

69,69,jw9tfd0,"It's not what you or I think. Sufi Qadiriyya sect like other religious minorities were persecuted. Tajuddin writes about it and he was a member of the sect. Earlier Iskander rasgefaanu kicked the Qadiriyya sects out of Maldives. They came back while his wife Mariyam was the regent, plot against her. Moheyddin brought back his a'lim who was briefly installed as a king.

 Then triggered the period where the ulema practically ruled Maldives and it was almost theocracy. Look at all the reforms made during this period, especially by Dhevadhoo rasgefaanu. A lot of radical social reforms were issued. He also rebuilt a lot of mosques, take a look at kuda huvadhoo mosque contrast between parts of the surviving portion of the old entrance and wall. 

Other than that we had a lot of religious turmoil, the whole war between the goan portuguese, their collaboraters and Utheemu brothers is explicitly described as a religious conflict by Tajuddin himself in Tarikh. In fact first two section of the manuscript is a political and religious treatise.

'Tarikh' is also filled with instances of executions by drowning, burning and beheadings all for different reasons; political, religious or just pissing of the king.

94,94,jwf1cae,"Why? Why should I adhere to any ideals when the Quran is clear enough to guide you? And there is no reason to turn atheist or agnostic to realize this. 

There is no concepts of Shia or Sunni in the Quran. Sunni and Shia were/are just political creations after the Prophet’s death in the wild struggle for political power in his absence. In the quest to legitimize and claim one was better over the other - rituals, narratives, morals and selective interpretations were ideated and created. After all, religion is a powerful opium to unite and control mass populations. As if the violent genocidal Crusades are testimony to this, the Second World War and the sectarian and communal strifes since then across the world is enough testimony how religion can be used to spread hate, violence, intolerance and bigotry.  

In its truest essence, Sufism is perhaps the best way to embrace Islam but unfortunately, it’s given a mystical Rastafarian tone while Sunnis and Shias want to outdo each other as the best version of Islam 🤷🏻‍♀️. In the meantime,  anti-Muslims and ignorant ex-Muslims stigmatize it as a violent religion that’s more interested in the rewards of the afterlife than the current life. 

If more Muslims and Non Muslims read and re-read the Quran in its entirety and also spend time reading its different interpretations by different authors/theologians/ex-Muslims/new Muslims; you’ll get the realization that it’s a unnecessarily maligned religion and I am pretty sure, not what God wanted to tell. 

I have also read the Bible (both the new and old) and it’s many interpretations, the Torah and also the Vedas and Bhagwad Gita of Hinduism and I believe all of them preach the secular oneness of god ultimately and preach elementary advice - that to be a good person and live an ethical altruistic kind happy life.

0,0,h8509nn,"I’ve spoken to many locals when there, and not all resorts and situations are created equal. I even saw a French TV report recently and it featured my local dive master / buddy. He was born on an island that is 10 mins away, so he could commute daily if conditions were horrendous, he chooses to live on the island. He earns a salary that wouldn’t be nearly horrible by western standards. I’m from the EU and I think it’s about 4 times our minimum wage. The dude who cleaned our rooms spoke very good English and he said he’d been cleaning the same 5 rooms for 25 years now. If it were such a horrible place to work he could’ve easily gone elsewhere with his level of English. I also heard that for some foods the crew get their own kind (like rice is cheaper rice from India) but for most of the things it’s the same as guests, for example there are cold cuts and bread out all day for the crew and anyone can make themselves sandwiches without any limits at any time. Keep in mind this is food they serve to people like Tom Hardy, the A list actor (it’s his favorite hotel).

The only thing unusual by western standards (albeit not that part of the world and esp not muslim countries), is that different people have different rights, but strangely enough the locals have the fewest. So they can’t drink alcohol or have pork in the resorts even if it’s available to staff for example. Things of that nature. 

I realize I only saw a slice, but when our waiter told us he earns plenty to make a living for his entire family and he gets more time off than we westerners do and he takes his family to one of many nice local islands for a beach vacation, I was actually somewhat envious. Nature is the same for everyone obviously. 

I know this might not be the standard, baseline and I am told this is one of the most “local centric” hotels in the entire country (even some of top management is local), but I don’t feel bad when I go there, I know that my money is definitely make a positive impact on the locals’ lives as well as being a minimal burden on the environment (they bottle their own water in glass, they sort the garbage vehemently, they have an incinerator, etc.). 

The hotel is called Lily Beach.

1,1,h85fphf,"Maldives had a change of government since 2018, the current government is more liberal and left-leaning compared to the more repressive government of Yameen Abdul Qayoom.  From what I recall, the ex-president of the Maldives was sentenced for 5 years for embezzlement few years ago. 

Last time Maldives had politically motivated internet censorship was back in the early 2000s when I was a teenager under Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's regime. While there are no internet censorship laws, I think there have been few cases where politicians abuse anti-defamation laws. I think people can get in trouble for making death threats to politicians. There's a lot about local politics and the progress of human rights issues since 2008 reforms, which I cannot summarise here in one post. 

Ever since the Maldives Independent and Minivan news shut down, you'll find fewer english language news outlets that does political analysis. But if you google, you may find some english language news outlets that are politically neutral.

As for the resorts, I recall a post in this subbreddit of a resort owner that was caught exploiting the local ecosystem. I think it is a good idea to boycott such resorts. You have to remember that Maldives is around 1000 small coral islands, and only 185 of them have local population. Just about 4 of them are considered as population centers. Resort owners can in practice disregards the local laws protecting the environment without any consequences.

You are right that most Maldivians probably do not experience Maldives as tourists do. Speaking from my own experience, I've never been to a resort and do not like the ocean but I've always appreciated the fact tourism rejuvenated the local economy in the 70s. 

Most social problems in the country have nothing to do with tourism. Before it became a republic, 'Maldives' was an exonym for a very old kingdom which had a centralised fuedal system in place to control their territory. The country became a british protectorate in 1887 because of a complex family rivalry within the ruling dynasty, which ended with one branch consolidating the power with the help of the British.

 From 1940s to late 1950s the kingdom was struggling to keep its territories under control, there were multiple secessionist movements from north and south of the kingdom. Tourism was introduced in 1970s after it became a republic with the same ruling class still holding power. 

Until very recently it was this same class of former nobility which held positions in the government. Even today the endonym for the country 'Dhivehi Raajje' literally means Island Kingdom. (Divehi actually refers to the language and ethnicity of the native islanders, but some scholars translate it to Islanders)",8,0,2021-08-08 08:48:34 UTC,0,z80lives,p0297h,t3_p0297h,2747,1628413285.0,False,maldives

We have a cultural dogma. I think the majority here believe that Maldivians are special because they are part of a pure group. 'No non-Muslims'. Uncorrupted by 'kafir' ideology. It's a legal fiction.

Maldivian institutional systems do not adequately support protection of ***any*** minority rights. But religious minorities just don't exist in the law. u/CapnHanSolo interestedly mentioned the Geneva Conventions. The situation here accurately contravenes the very spirit of the 1992 declaration on minorities (UNGA resolution 47/135) and of Maldives' own constitutional protections (Chapter 2).

If you're a religious minority, and you have angered the majority - they are legally sanctioned to imprison you. There's no sense in sugar-coating it. How often this happens is irrelevant to the fact that it is allowed to happen and there's a framework for it. If the moratorium on death penalty is lifted, they can even execute you. A legal murder. Maldivian law is stubborn and unjust in this area.

Minority groups are substantial enough that people can always live a relatively free life if we do not push the majority narrative too hard. But with both groups as vocal as they are now, I feel that might not be the case soon.

PS:. Tourism in Maldives has existed in enclaves. Bubbles. Workers at guesthouses at substantially tourist islands like Maafushi are distant from the experience of Maldivians in inhabited islands and cities (who form the majority vote). They are valuable input as experience of Maldivians, but they live very far from institutions and the law (labour law too, sadly).",3,0,2021-08-23 08:38:34 UTC,0,paradiserythm,p9jy34,t3_p9jy34,1743,False,False,maldives

Basically the British showed support for the Suadives but at the end of the day double crossed and made an agreement with the Male' government.

January 1960 - Addu atoll formally establishes Republic of Suvadive headed by Afeef Didi in Hithadhoo. Huvadhu and Fua Mulak atoll are also nominally part of Suvadive, but the British give protection only to Addu atoll.

April 1962 - British attempt to restore Addu to Male' rule but large violent demonstration in Gan rejects any change.

January/February 1962 - Ibrahim Nasir, aboard the Silver Crest, leads another armed attack on Thinadhoo on Huvadhu atoll, and Fua Mulak. Thinadhoo is leveled and population dispersed. Many people, driven from Thinadhoo onto surrounding islands, starve to death.

September 1963 - British agree to return Addu to Male' control by the end of 1963.
British political advisor Rounswaite actively lobbies Addu businessmen against Afeef and his administration.
Britain plans to establish a new and more powerful BBC short wave relay station on Maldives to serve Asia and East Africa.
Regiment from Butterworth in Malaysia ordered to Gan, and Rounswaite orders the Maldives flag to be raised in Maradhoo. Afeef and his supporters agree to end their revolt.
30 September 1963 - Abdulla Afeef and his family taken to Seychelles aboard HMS Loch Lomond.

* Dhiffushi (big island) (6 days)
* Dhiffushi Resort (small island) (5 days)
* Malé. (2 days)

I am:

* From Denmark
* Fully vaccinated

1 day before flying, I will do a PCR test.

According to these rules [here](https://covid19.health.gov.mv/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-criteria-for-permitting-tourist-arrivals/?c=0):

* PCR test 4 days prior arrival in Maldives
* PCR test 3 days before check-out of each guesthouse

* 1 in Denmark
* 1 before check-out of the first hotel
* 1 before check-out of the second hotel

Before going to the second hotel I need to do another PCR test, but I can't find any information on where to do the PCR test on [Dhiffushi](https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Dhiffushi/@4.4419622,73.7114756,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b3f916d9c4395c5:0x89b05894a4ae0485!8m2!3d4.4401762!4d73.7132147).

\- Split stay is allowed now.

\- The guesthouse/ resorts will be arranging all the formalities associated with split stay for you.

\- you dont need to do PCR test before moving from one island to another. Just need to make sure the islands are not under monitoring list. (in my case the local islands are Maafushi and Fulidhoo).

22,22,hj4bgtw,"Hi buddy,

I have contacted the resort (Meeru Island Resort) and unfortunately they require the following:

* NO visiting of local island before coming to the private resort. If you go to a local island, you will NOT be allowed to enter the private island, even if you have a negative PCR test
* If you choose to stay at another resort before coming to the next resort, you must send them a negative PCR test 48 hours PRIOR arrival.


So you CANNOT do it in the following order:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Local island (they do not care if you have a negative PCR test result with you)
* Resort

You CAN do the following:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort
* Local island 

You CAN also do it like this:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort - take a PCR test 48 hours prior arrival at next resort 
* Resort 


About the split-stays: it's possible and the place you are staying will do the formalities, just inform them where you are going next. If you can do it, send them an email with this information before going to the Maldives.

I will advice you to contact the resort you are staying at and ask them about the restrictions they have. It seems like the resorts can make their own COVID restrictions..

When are you going?

1,1,j1c561i,"There’s a lot of sense in what OP is trying to say but unfortunately I don’t think that we can overcome this issue in the near future as there could be several factors contributing to this targeted xenophobia. 

I think that we’re stuck in an odd yet hopeful juncture; modern vs traditional. The former being predominant among among Gen Z, lower age group from Millennials and the latter ideology and customs being distributed highly among Gen X and older millennials. This affects how each of these groups perceive and accept societal and cultural norms as well as see the flaws and areas for improvement. To put it short: it’s the young ones who can break this chain of bias and bigotry. 

As for how we Maldivians treat foreigners: be it tourists or expatriates, you don’t have to look far to understand this elitism or sense of superiority (Malé vs non-Malé inhabitants/residents). When we view fellow countrymen and women from different parts of the country as inferior, how can we treat citizens of different nationalities with equality? Sad truth is the people of this country is a prime example of Dunning-Kruger effect and superiority complexes everywhere. 

Then there’s the political element. Remember the herd mentality prevalent among Maldivians. Sheeple indeed. We’re stuck at a challenging position when it comes to geo politics. Depending on the leader, bilateral relations and alliances vary and as such today it might be pro-India, tomorrow pro-China and so on. So whatever (mis)information and propaganda is directed from the top is what comes down to the average citizen as well.

Anyway, since you are discussing about what 'Maldivians' think of themselves, I got some things to add. 

I think, what we now think of as modern Maldivian identity and nationalism emerged mid 20th century forged by the ruling class of the time. History was revised; it was no longer a persian but a moroccan who was buried in the central shrine. 

Hussein Salahuddin sanitized the Boduthakurufaanu story (compared to Buraara koi) and further framed it as an anti-colonial struggle. It was previously framed as a religious and political struggle by Hassan Tajuddin in the 18th century manuscript. 

Somewhere over time the local form of Sufi Islam became part of the culture and eventually after several religious reformations it was superceded by a more mainstream Islam. Before that,  based on few lines of the surviving copperplate from 13th century (Kudahuvadhoo) it looks like early Maldivian Islam was a localised form of the religion with syncretic elements.

Maybe a large part of our current problem is that the dichotomy between religion and culture was never properly addressed by Maldivians themselves. The common perception is that Islam was introduced in 12th CE as it was practiced until the early 20th. However, if you look at the written records it is evidently false, there was a lot of persecutions; both religious and political and over time what we now think of as Dhivehi identity emerged. 


My point is, we have to understand that 'Dhivehi' culture itself has evolved a lot over time and it's likely going to keep changing like any other culture. The best we can do is to reflect and try to understand how we came here.


p.s: Maldivians have been fetishizing/emulating Arabs and Persians atleast for 5 centuries. However, our religious words and concepts are still rooted in borrowed Sanskrit phrases inherited from the Buddhist traditions.  Until the 19th century our word for God was Dheyvatha. Five century was a long time, so I wouldn't worry about Arabisation of Dhivehi culture within the next 100 years.",5,0,2022-12-22 10:33:50 UTC,2,z80lives,zseqd9,t3_zseqd9,2162,False,False,maldives

I had a similar experience while I was visiting the Maldives. I found many people had a great deal of respect and admiration for the European and Arab cultures, but at the same time, the same cultures shared some of the same values which I had seen in other parts of Asia, such as the importance of family and mental health.
