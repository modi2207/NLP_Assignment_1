jbnt8n9,"Thank you so much for taking so much time and effort to reply in this level of detail.

This is way more than I ever hoped to get.

>I might have some photographs and relevant documents possibly from the declassified archives. I can link it here in an edits if it is relevant to you and if it's not against this subreddit's rule.

I think I have more than enough for the game, so don't want to impose on your time if you are busy, or if it's too much effort. In case you get some free time, please do share -  would love to read, just out of curiosity/interest - I am sure rest of the subreddit would appreciate it as well.  

In the meantime, will try to process all of the info you have shared. 

Thank you once again. 

PS: It's a relatively obscure game mod, but if there is something I can do to acknowledge your help within the mod (like giving a political advisor or military commander a name of your choice, or including some easter egg), please do let me know.",2.0,1.0,2023-03-10 11:16:55 UTC,0.0,Chocolate_Horlicks,11mscwj,t1_jbnqqau,980.0,FALSE,True,maldives,0.991235852,0.001080285,0.00768382,0.80924052,0.017933248,0.172826245,0.219258964,0.003471002,0.777270079,positive,positive,neutral,positive

I worked in the reservations department at the four seasons so our work hours were fixed unlike most of the other staff at the resort. I would usually wrap up by 4 every day and be in the water either kayaking or snorkeling. On my days off I went with the resident marine biologist to hanifaru bay of wherever else he went and basically assisted. At night after dinner chilled at the lounge playing pool or video games.

This was my first job out of high school so I was very excited and participated in every single thing I could. Most of the older colleagues just ate and watched movies and talked to their loved ones on the phone. So I guess if you‚Äôre doing only those things you could go crazy after a few months.

jpylkyf,Pay was alright but this was 2010-2011 and it was the four seasons. The food was amazing since it‚Äôs cheaper for the resorts to buy the same ingredients as the guests in bulk. But it‚Äôs a fixed menu that rotates each week so after a few weeks some people do get bored. And yes the food is free at the staff restaurant. I have a few friends that worked in not so fancy resorts that didn‚Äôt have as good an experience so I guess it really depends on where you go.

js37r3s,"I think there are a lot of things that will need to change before things get better in that sense.

For one thing let me talk about the general public for a moment. Even though we call ourselves a Republic I do not believe our collective consciousness has truly embraced or understood the idea of a Republic or a Democracy. 

And this is ingrained on a cultural level starting from the royalty and the psuedo democracy that replaced that with beyfulhun's. Let us take a look at our language for one thing. In democracies we have leaders, not rulers. But to us we have only verin. Verin is the word for rulers, leaders and even owners. I am the verimeeha of the property I own. I should not be the verimeeha of people I am meant to lead.

And this mentality can be seen when you really think about it. We elect people, but then have this expectation that if the president/minister etc wants something to happen that should happen.

Ask people you know in your field of work for for a tea/coffee or just hangout in general. Avoid talking politics first and things you don't have in common.  Have conversations about things you like, TV shows, music or fishing. People who share some common interest as you will start to hang out more often.

jsk9pbf,"Few, but none of them happend in Maldives.

Let's see,
At Lanka. On the 3rd day there ,was stuck in traffic at a busy junction. Just barely got out of the traffic to enter a building at the other corner of the junction.
After 3 mins goin inside. Whole building shook like there was an earthquake and a loud noise deafening my hearing. Stuck in position heart beating like it would pop out. Didn't know what was going on. Untill I got out after a few mins to see whole junction in smokes lots of vehicles parts in debris and far off where exactly we were stuck  4 mins before it happened  there were pools....... Hmm well just say not a sight one would ever wanna see or experiance ever in their life . And the realisation just 4 mins ,just 4 mins and it would have been end of me.  

.. well after this met with 2 other blast at very close proximity. To realise and feel the impact of the blasts. But never got as scared as tht first time. Last two there were no casualties.

And don't worry these were long long back. Since the war is over. Nothing like this could be there. Even then it was pretty safe mostly. Only my luck was on good and bad terms.

jstsq1e,"It could very well be a contributing factor but I think how one is raised is far more important. I have been renting my whole life, but I am the kind of person who tries to bring even an empty bottle home so that I can put it in my dustbin. I also dis-agree that people don't litter in their own houses, you will be surprised at just how filthy some places are.

I think it's mainly a matter of the collective culture, and also a bit of the broken window theory from sociology. Which states that existing signs of anti social behavior encourages further anti-social behavior. 

The idea here being that litter/dirt attracts more dirt. Even I have been guilty of this sometimes. If I see a pile of rubbish on the street it is easy to think my additional bottle or tissue paper won't make a difference. And this is also kind of apparent if you go to a lot of islands outside the greater male' area. Where you have garbage free beaches or streets. They still litter there to an extent too. But people will rarely want to be the first guy to spoil a pristine beach or street, so they will chuck it into the trees XD (which is still bad and where the idea of littering being culturally acceptable comes in)

And of course another issue is the lack of public bins. In like most other countries I have been in, you can easily find public bins to put in simple garbage like wrappers or bottles, but not here. And there is a reason for this too. When that was tried it was either destroyed or people just dumb in household waste that rots and destroys or just stuff they don't want to take to the dump. So again culture playing in.

We definitely do need to punish people who litter. Properly punishing, and enforcing such punishments and yes even shaming people for littering definitely would go a long way towards changing this culture. Those that don't litter in their own houses but do in public, do so because at home they will face consequences. Been forced to clean up or been yelled at by those who have to clean up after them. Whereas if you face no consequences for doing it in public they will just keep doing it.",9.0,0.0,2023-07-21 04:45:08 UTC,0.0,crimson_solace,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,2115.0,FALSE,False,maldives,0.001043573,0.99454993,0.004406513,0.022725996,0.573505461,0.40376851,,,,nagative,negative,,nagative

jsuh2i0,"Personally, I have never been someone who litters, so I never really understood why anyone could litter. However, I did read a lot about it, and like it was mentioned in a previous comment, your theory could be one of the factors. 

A lack of bins is also certainly comtributing factor. This issue mostly ties in with city planning I suppose. Finding public waste disposal areas in the Mal√© and Hulhumal√© certainly is quite the task. 

However, some people just choose to litter even when bins are nearby. Again, as mentioned in a previous comment, littering has become so prevalent in our society that we feel our own littering won't contribute much to the issue. Or some people probably just don't care about it. 

Like you mentioned, passing legislature regarding littering and proper enforcement could encourage people not to litter. We tend to pass a lot of bills and introduce a lot of new laws here, but the laws are usually not enforced very well. So, there's that as well. 

I also think that we can incentivize not littering by rewarding people who don't litter.

That said given that the dynamic of this subreddit is changing perhaps the mods can take it into consideration and implement some changes and they are active.

Recently tried KFZ- korean food zone  at hulhumale.  It is run by a Korean lady. Cute personality and creates the vibe and feel of a Korean place. And the food is authentic  . Thou might be just slightly a little high end on the pricing. It is worth for the experience.


As for symphony and  Italian dishes. Hmmm well they are too Maldivianized. At this point.  Yeah I understand cannot serve most Italian dishes due to halal. But can keep to the concept the theme of the original dish. 
For instance carbonara base of the dish is 
- Cured pork cheeks /pancetta 
- egg/egg yolks 
- parmesan/ pecorino

So why not just replace the cured meat with a halal beef based cured meat. Still this will not change the base of the dish. Which is even a served variant  in Italy to ppl who eat halal.

But here mostly it's take aways the eggs. Adds cream/ milk, Bell pepper. Cheddar cheese. Cream cheese parsley leafs . It is all a mushy mess.

I like harvest moon back to nature, digimon world 1, 2 and 3 plus digimon card battle, which are all ps1 games, but my fav digimon game is digimon world next order. I like turn based games too like civ games and ff games, especially ff8 but ff15 is my fav game in the ff series. While I'm on ff, I should say I didn't play all the ff games and would like to mention I liked dissidia too. I don't particularly like God of war but still a good game that I did enjoy. I like dmc too, haven't played dmc 1 and 5 yet, 3 has been my fav so far. Also I like the assassin's Creed games, playing unity now and I actually played all the main assassin's Creed games up to unity. For mobile games, the online games I play are mobile legends bang bang and coc, for an offline game I play an indie game called world rumble. Also would like to mention mount and blade 2: bannerlord, while I'm not particularly good in this game I do enjoy it. I did play dark souls but didn't finish it, I would maybe finish them in the future but for now I have other games I want to try more. I also like games like red alert, Warhammer 40k dawn of war, age of empires. For red alert, I liked red alert 2 Yuri's revenge the best and for age of empires, I liked 2 best.

jv2rjoq,"I haven't played video game more recently, but I used to play a lot. Most of them are a bit older, but I hope you'll enjoy them. I'll list down 10 games that has good replay value.

1. Final Fantasy VI
2. The Sims
3. Mass effect series (- not Andromeda, that's garbage)
4. Super Metroid
5. Castlevania 
6. Fire Emblem any of the GBA games
7. Mother / Earthbound series.
8. Tetris
9. X-Com
10. Elder Scrolls (any game in this series holds up)

I picked ff6, because I played all final fantasy titles progressively till 10 and it is really the best one. Along with Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Lufia II it's probably the best jrpg of it's time. 

Mass effect, because it has a decent story and good space opera. 

Castlevania and Metroid, has the best gameplay ever designed. Discovered Super Metroid when I wrote a paper on it (about symbolism and narrative) for college assignment (also portal and ""To the moon""), it has a good replay value. 

Fire Emblem; I played to pass time when commuting.
X-COM and battle toad whenever I wanted something challenging, I hate contra and metal slug is way easy.

Tetris, hard to believe for some but probably the best game ever made. I used to write tetris and snake in every new language, emulator or platform I work on. Even wrote one for ""z80lives"", my old partially complete but abandoned z80 based computer emulator suite.  Ironically it's name ""lives"" on as my internet handle.

jvgaddz,"My favourite game developer so far is From Software.
Especially Starting from Demons Souls back in 09 every game they released so far has been really enjoyable to play. Bloodborne is my personal favourite video game of all time.

Other series i really like are Uncharted and Gow of war. 

Additionally; 

Liked GTA Sa and GTA 3 ( 4 and 5 not so much lol )

RDR 2 is a masterpiece  ( haven't played 1 )

FF16 and FF7 are excellent as well

Assassin's Creed ( up to syndicate. haven't played anything after that )

Resident Evil (all the recent ones)

Ghost of Tsushima

TLOU 1 ( 2 is utter trash btw )

Dmc ( every main entry apart from dmc 2 is really good)

Prince of Persia sands of time and warrior within ( ahh the nostalgia, really wish Ubisoft would remake these 2 )

jv959n4,"As a thalassemic patient myself. As in not a career but someone who has to take regular transfusions, my answer to this has always been don't break up JUST because of that. It is a controversial opinion yes and people usually disagree with me on this.  


First let me just give you the obvious options of adopting or as mentioned here the genetic engineering IVF avenues if you have the money. Though I am not 100% sure how viable that is. You should do a bit more research on that. But if any of those are an option for you, then I mean you have no issues right?  
On the issue of having an actual thalasemic child, here is how I see things. Even thalassemia aside life has no guarantees. You could get a child who requires some special care in another form. Yes marrying as career's raises that risk, but in a sense, it also gives you the chance to consider whether that is something both of you can face as a couple. There is a quote I quite like, It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease, than to know what sort of disease a person has. Here it is what sort of person you are that would matter. Even today due to lack of awareness a lot of people will see thalasemic's as sick. Sick in the sense they are weak and cannot do everything normal people does. But that is not true at all, with proper treatment, there are thalasemic's doing all sort of things. One even goes bodu kahneli fishing ah. As you know that is a very physically demanding job.  


What is most important to understand is that it's going to be physically, mentally and financially draining. Especially when the child is young and don't understand things, you are going to have to force them to take the proper treatment. They will cry and fight against it, and you will have to be strong enough to deal with that. And while there are now tablet medications that can be used, most thalasemic's still take medication through a syringe and a pump that has to be on them throughout the night on most nights. When I was doing thing it meant sacrificing evenings because I did not want to go out like that. But there are many that do. And if you can afford it there are small easy to carry pumps as well.  


Which comes to the financial aspect. Do not think that the government will take care of everything, so you don't have to worry. For one thing sometimes you have to spend for better quality of life than government provides. And while a lot of tests and stuff can be done here now, you must consider that sometimes you may have to go abroad, and even with all the social protection that is still quite a hassle, and can be financially burdensome. And then there is the whole thing of further studies like degrees and stuff. If the kid wants to go abroad for studies, unless in very rare circumstances you are going to have to foot the bill of their treatment, the government will not cover that. I faced this in my own studies.  


So I suppose the bottom line is can you handle all this, both financially, and as a couple. And the whole issue of putting your child through all this. Well that is a very difficult thing to answer and I suppose would depend on the kind of kid he/she turns out to be. I rarely if ever felt like bad for been a thalasemic. That would be a combination of my parents plus my own personality, so ofcours mileage is going to vary. But I think been a strong example for your child, and not treating them as like weak and sick will go far.  


If you have any people who you trust and knows the both of you well and will be honest with you talk to them. Ask for their honest opinion even if it will hurt you, see if they think you can handle all this, and your marriage will survive it. Think about it all on your own, then make the decision you think would be best for you.",1.0,0.0,2023-08-08 03:26:52 UTC,7.0,crimson_solace,15kluod,t3_15kluod,3797.0,FALSE,False,maldives,0.063627556,0.537812352,0.398560077,0.066980779,0.185905233,0.747114003,,,,nagative,neutral,,nagative

jviurn1,"I am all for selecting a non thalaseamic embryo via ivf screening. But as of now that is not something easily accessible for everyone in the similar way say just screening for thalassemia is.

And you have honestly highlighted my major issue. There are many other things that are passed genetically and can be screened for. But you rarely if ever hear someone saying about screening for those (yes I know you just did). There definitely isn't a systematic mandate in place to screen for anything other than thalassemia. And you certainly don't hear about people breaking up because they might pass on other genetic issues. It's only thalassemia that seems to be this significant medical diagnosis that is a cruel burden on the children. And that creates a very bad and untruthful impression about thalassemic patients on the general public as well on the patients themselves.

And while I am fully for screening embryos and choosing the best one, where does genetic screening when choosing partners lead? There are so many genetic conditions. Are we going to say some are ok and others are not? What someone thinks as significant will also differ from person to person. Are we going to avoid everything? At that point we might as well just upload our dna profiles and make matches based on just that.

Maldives is a monoethnic nation - like Malays of Malaysia - we seem to have infused cultural and religious identity. So I don't think state hold on religion will go away anytime soon.

We also have this religious nationalism formed not long ago and more recently a pan Islamic identity (btw, modern salafi movement also falls under Islamic modernism).

>What about allowing expats to construct places of worship?

Funny that's it's now a touchy subject for a lot of people. We had a chapel in Addu for the british and it was not that controversial back then.

It's important to improve the human rights and living conditions of the expats and freely practicing their own religion on their personal space is part of that.

And as long as these people in power stay in these high places of power influencing Muslims and non-Muslims with their bigotry; Islam will continue to get a bad name. 

And it‚Äôs not just about Islam, Hinduism is also going through this turmoil. Just look at what‚Äôs happening in India where far right Hindu fanatics have hijacked the Hindu religion and created a Jihadi version of it. 

Even in Christianity, the rise of intolerant right wing and far right practitioners has given rise to right wing dictators and politicians to power.

Flimsy? You mean Tarikh specifically, or just the few documents we have laying around?

üòÇ Yeah, I agree Tarikh manuscripts are biased. After all they all serve a political purpose for Hassan Tajuddin and his family who was very much involved with the events they're talking about. Other than that the first hand records we have from different periods are as close as you can get in terms of historical veracity.

>was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III

We don't call him Iskandar III, that's not his name and we also don't number our sultans like the British. Sultan Shamsuddin Iskander III is the third king with Shamsuddin name. First was the foreign king, other uncle of dhon bandaara who built kallhu vakaru miskiy and then him. Maldivian sultan's reignal name usually have an identifier to distinguish other than the biruda and full arabic title we get. For example, Dhiyamigili Ibrahim rasgefaanu would be Ibrahim Iskander II and only Iskander rasgefaanu in any context would mean Utheemi Ibrahim Iskander I. Imadduddin II, III and IV is known to Maldivians by 'Muzaffar', 'Mukarram' and 'Muskulhi' prefix other than their local names. 

P.S I guess we have similar political leanings.

Moheyddin brought back his a'lim who was briefly installed as a king.

 Then triggered the period where the ulema practically ruled Maldives and it was almost theocracy. Look at all the reforms made during this period, especially by Dhevadhoo rasgefaanu. A lot of radical social reforms were issued. He also rebuilt a lot of mosques, take a look at kuda huvadhoo mosque contrast between parts of the surviving portion of the old entrance and wall. 

Other than that we had a lot of religious turmoil, the whole war between the goan portuguese, their collaboraters and Utheemu brothers is explicitly described as a religious conflict by Tajuddin himself in Tarikh. In fact first two section of the manuscript is a political and religious treatise.

'Tarikh' is also filled with instances of executions by drowning, burning and beheadings all for different reasons; political, religious or just pissing of the king.

Islam in my opinion is a just a way of life - to be a nice ethical person. And that‚Äôs about it.

All the other things muslim do are just rituals that many devout Muslims indulge it; not mandatory things the Quran asks you to do. 

Of course there are bad things in Quran but we have to apply common sense and see it from the historical time and society of those days when it was imposed upon.

I don‚Äôt prescribe to what conservative and ignorant hard stance Muslim preachers and extreme leaders preach or dictate how a Muslim should live their life. People who blindly follow them are just too lazy to research and critique Islam. So, they grow up following this ritualistic pattern of Islam which they pass on to their next generation.

jwf1cae,"Why? Why should I adhere to any ideals when the Quran is clear enough to guide you? And there is no reason to turn atheist or agnostic to realize this. 

There is no concepts of Shia or Sunni in the Quran. Sunni and Shia were/are just political creations after the Prophet‚Äôs death in the wild struggle for political power in his absence. In the quest to legitimize and claim one was better over the other - rituals, narratives, morals and selective interpretations were ideated and created. After all, religion is a powerful opium to unite and control mass populations. As if the violent genocidal Crusades are testimony to this, the Second World War and the sectarian and communal strifes since then across the world is enough testimony how religion can be used to spread hate, violence, intolerance and bigotry.

jwgfp94,"I do believe that most of these occurences are most likely because of mental illness, but I do think some cases are genuine cases of posession. Like I mentioned in a previous comment, it's very difficult to differentiate between cases of actual posession and that of mental illness. When you're posessed you tend to see things that are not there and when you hallucinate it is the same. In both cases, your perception of reality is warped. However, in both cases, the fear, and the anxiety you experience are very much real. 

The wellness industry survives because for some people it works. Things like essential oils, alternative medicine, rugya, etc. I'm not saying anyone who has symptoms of mental illness should go and try these things, but when all other options have been exhausted, it is worth trying these methods. Scientifically, we lack research on a lot of these non-clinical practices, but some of them like meditation has been proven to bring positive effects.

Soneva promised to have villas ready for quarantine free of charge alongside On-site PCR testing and on-site lab for results.Considering that Soneva is at 2500 USD a night on active monsoon days and 3000 USD on high-season I wouldn't doubt that this is affordable for Soneva, but too good to believe.

But given that the boat on the article from Kathrin Schuler was redirected I don't really expect that to be possible for similar cases like ""guy on the plane tested positive, whole plane-quarantine..."" or collection boats collecting different ressort-people.

A lot of people just chalk up Maldives to be either island resorts or capital city Mal√©.

The capital is one of the most densely populated places on earth. But its far from all this country has to offer.

An inhabited island has nearly everything a resort has to offer, with actual people and actual culture.

Edit; for all of you that arent aware, Maldives is actually comprised of 1190 fully formed islands, and many more sandbanks and reefs. Mal√© houses a chunk of the nation‚Äôs population, but its not ‚Äòwhere everyone lives‚Äô. Far from it.

h8509nn,"I‚Äôve spoken to many locals when there, and not all resorts and situations are created equal. I even saw a French TV report recently and it featured my local dive master / buddy. He was born on an island that is 10 mins away, so he could commute daily if conditions were horrendous, he chooses to live on the island. He earns a salary that wouldn‚Äôt be nearly horrible by western standards. I‚Äôm from the EU and I think it‚Äôs about 4 times our minimum wage. The dude who cleaned our rooms spoke very good English and he said he‚Äôd been cleaning the same 5 rooms for 25 years now. If it were such a horrible place to work he could‚Äôve easily gone elsewhere with his level of English. I also heard that for some foods the crew get their own kind (like rice is cheaper rice from India) but for most of the things it‚Äôs the same as guests, for example there are cold cuts and bread out all day for the crew and anyone can make themselves sandwiches without any limits at any time. Keep in mind this is food they serve to people like Tom Hardy, the A list actor (it‚Äôs his favorite hotel).

The only thing unusual by western standards (albeit not that part of the world and esp not muslim countries), is that different people have different rights, but strangely enough the locals have the fewest. So they can‚Äôt drink alcohol or have pork in the resorts even if it‚Äôs available to staff for example. Things of that nature. 

I realize I only saw a slice, but when our waiter told us he earns plenty to make a living for his entire family and he gets more time off than we westerners do and he takes his family to one of many nice local islands for a beach vacation, I was actually somewhat envious. Nature is the same for everyone obviously. 

I know this might not be the standard, baseline and I am told this is one of the most ‚Äúlocal centric‚Äù hotels in the entire country (even some of top management is local), but I don‚Äôt feel bad when I go there, I know that my money is definitely make a positive impact on the locals‚Äô lives as well as being a minimal burden on the environment (they bottle their own water in glass, they sort the garbage vehemently, they have an incinerator, etc.). 

The hotel is called Lily Beach.

h85fphf,"Maldives had a change of government since 2018, the current government is more liberal and left-leaning compared to the more repressive government of Yameen Abdul Qayoom.  From what I recall, the ex-president of the Maldives was sentenced for 5 years for embezzlement few years ago. 

Last time Maldives had politically motivated internet censorship was back in the early 2000s when I was a teenager under Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's regime. While there are no internet censorship laws, I think there have been few cases where politicians abuse anti-defamation laws. I think people can get in trouble for making death threats to politicians. There's a lot about local politics and the progress of human rights issues since 2008 reforms, which I cannot summarise here in one post. 

Ever since the Maldives Independent and Minivan news shut down, you'll find fewer english language news outlets that does political analysis. But if you google, you may find some english language news outlets that are politically neutral.

As for the resorts, I recall a post in this subbreddit of a resort owner that was caught exploiting the local ecosystem. I think it is a good idea to boycott such resorts. You have to remember that Maldives is around 1000 small coral islands, and only 185 of them have local population. Just about 4 of them are considered as population centers. Resort owners can in practice disregards the local laws protecting the environment without any consequences.

You are right that most Maldivians probably do not experience Maldives as tourists do. Speaking from my own experience, I've never been to a resort and do not like the ocean but I've always appreciated the fact tourism rejuvenated the local economy in the 70s. 

Most social problems in the country have nothing to do with tourism. Before it became a republic, 'Maldives' was an exonym for a very old kingdom which had a centralised fuedal system in place to control their territory. The country became a british protectorate in 1887 because of a complex family rivalry within the ruling dynasty, which ended with one branch consolidating the power with the help of the British.

 From 1940s to late 1950s the kingdom was struggling to keep its territories under control, there were multiple secessionist movements from north and south of the kingdom. Tourism was introduced in 1970s after it became a republic with the same ruling class still holding power. 

Until very recently it was this same class of former nobility which held positions in the government. Even today the endonym for the country 'Dhivehi Raajje' literally means Island Kingdom. (Divehi actually refers to the language and ethnicity of the native islanders, but some scholars translate it to Islanders)",8.0,0.0,2021-08-08 08:48:34 UTC,0.0,z80lives,p0297h,t3_p0297h,2747.0,1628413285,False,maldives,0.00115514,0.992751241,0.006093628,0.01956529,0.486753374,0.493681371,,,,nagative,neutral,,nagative

ha0e7bx,"Haha, I'm glad I skimmed through the introduction of that report. 'You make your own soul', ok. But I agree with its findings about the Maldives.

We have a cultural dogma. I think the majority here believe that Maldivians are special because they are part of a pure group. 'No non-Muslims'. Uncorrupted by 'kafir' ideology. It's a legal fiction.

Maldivian institutional systems do not adequately support protection of ***any*** minority rights. But religious minorities just don't exist in the law. u/CapnHanSolo interestedly mentioned the Geneva Conventions. The situation here accurately contravenes the very spirit of the 1992 declaration on minorities (UNGA resolution 47/135) and of Maldives' own constitutional protections (Chapter 2).

If you're a religious minority, and you have angered the majority - they are legally sanctioned to imprison you. There's no sense in sugar-coating it. How often this happens is irrelevant to the fact that it is allowed to happen and there's a framework for it. If the moratorium on death penalty is lifted, they can even execute you. A legal murder. Maldivian law is stubborn and unjust in this area.

Minority groups are substantial enough that people can always live a relatively free life if we do not push the majority narrative too hard. But with both groups as vocal as they are now, I feel that might not be the case soon.

PS:. Tourism in Maldives has existed in enclaves. Bubbles. Workers at guesthouses at substantially tourist islands like Maafushi are distant from the experience of Maldivians in inhabited islands and cities (who form the majority vote). They are valuable input as experience of Maldivians, but they live very far from institutions and the law (labour law too, sadly).",3.0,0.0,2021-08-23 08:38:34 UTC,0.0,paradiserythm,p9jy34,t3_p9jy34,1743.0,FALSE,False,maldives,0.517501652,0.158845022,0.323653311,0.688081503,0.029857073,0.282061398,,,,positive,positive,,positive
ha083ru,"Ok check this out. We have literal 'thought-control' over here.

Imagine a scenario where you make a social media post supporting another religion (Christianity, Judaism or other non-abrahamic-religion) or simply supporting religious toleration. The fucking ""Islamic Ministry"" would get into it. You will be hauled of to ""re-educate"" which is dubbed as ""Naseyhai"" here which roughly translates to advice. Since the fucking law here states that every Maldivian should be a Muslim (Or something in that regard that have the same effect). I think they make you repent or some shit lol

So take that. Exercise religion toleration here and you will be shutdown. This shit is straight-up against Geneva Convention (Might as well call Geneva suggestion, amiright?). And this is the just the legal side of it.

There is whole plethora of religious fruitcakes who have been increasingly getting violent to the point of blowing shit up in the name of some fucktards in middle-east.

So yeah you're free if you're a willing to be a religious cuck. Thats just my $.02.

ha1m51z,"Just read through it. 

Basically the British showed support for the Suadives but at the end of the day double crossed and made an agreement with the Male' government.

January 1960 - Addu atoll formally establishes Republic of Suvadive headed by Afeef Didi in Hithadhoo. Huvadhu and Fua Mulak atoll are also nominally part of Suvadive, but the British give protection only to Addu atoll.

April 1962 - British attempt to restore Addu to Male' rule but large violent demonstration in Gan rejects any change.

January/February 1962 - Ibrahim Nasir, aboard the Silver Crest, leads another armed attack on Thinadhoo on Huvadhu atoll, and Fua Mulak. Thinadhoo is leveled and population dispersed. Many people, driven from Thinadhoo onto surrounding islands, starve to death.

September 1963 - British agree to return Addu to Male' control by the end of 1963.
British political advisor Rounswaite actively lobbies Addu businessmen against Afeef and his administration.
Britain plans to establish a new and more powerful BBC short wave relay station on Maldives to serve Asia and East Africa.
Regiment from Butterworth in Malaysia ordered to Gan, and Rounswaite orders the Maldives flag to be raised in Maradhoo. Afeef and his supporters agree to end their revolt.
30 September 1963 - Abdulla Afeef and his family taken to Seychelles aboard HMS Loch Lomond.

* From Denmark
* Fully vaccinated

Before going to the second hotel I need to do another PCR test, but I can't find any information on where to do the PCR test on [Dhiffushi](https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Dhiffushi/@4.4419622,73.7114756,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b3f916d9c4395c5:0x89b05894a4ae0485!8m2!3d4.4401762!4d73.7132147).

hj4bgtw,"Hi buddy,

I have contacted the resort (Meeru Island Resort) and unfortunately they require the following:

* NO visiting of local island before coming to the private resort. If you go to a local island, you will NOT be allowed to enter the private island, even if you have a negative PCR test
* If you choose to stay at another resort before coming to the next resort, you must send them a negative PCR test 48 hours PRIOR arrival.


So you CANNOT do it in the following order:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Local island (they do not care if you have a negative PCR test result with you)
* Resort

You CAN do the following:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort
* Local island 

You CAN also do it like this:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort - take a PCR test 48 hours prior arrival at next resort 
* Resort 


About the split-stays: it's possible and the place you are staying will do the formalities, just inform them where you are going next. If you can do it, send them an email with this information before going to the Maldives.

I will advice you to contact the resort you are staying at and ask them about the restrictions they have. It seems like the resorts can make their own COVID restrictions..

When are you going?

Anyway, since you are discussing about what 'Maldivians' think of themselves, I got some things to add. 

I think, what we now think of as modern Maldivian identity and nationalism emerged mid 20th century forged by the ruling class of the time. History was revised; it was no longer a persian but a moroccan who was buried in the central shrine. 

Hussein Salahuddin sanitized the Boduthakurufaanu story (compared to Buraara koi) and further framed it as an anti-colonial struggle. It was previously framed as a religious and political struggle by Hassan Tajuddin in the 18th century manuscript. 

Somewhere over time the local form of Sufi Islam became part of the culture and eventually after several religious reformations it was superceded by a more mainstream Islam. Before that,  based on few lines of the surviving copperplate from 13th century (Kudahuvadhoo) it looks like early Maldivian Islam was a localised form of the religion with syncretic elements.

Maybe a large part of our current problem is that the dichotomy between religion and culture was never properly addressed by Maldivians themselves. The common perception is that Islam was introduced in 12th CE as it was practiced until the early 20th. However, if you look at the written records it is evidently false, there was a lot of persecutions; both religious and political and over time what we now think of as Dhivehi identity emerged. 


My point is, we have to understand that 'Dhivehi' culture itself has evolved a lot over time and it's likely going to keep changing like any other culture. The best we can do is to reflect and try to understand how we came here.


p.s: Maldivians have been fetishizing/emulating Arabs and Persians atleast for 5 centuries. However, our religious words and concepts are still rooted in borrowed Sanskrit phrases inherited from the Buddhist traditions.  Until the 19th century our word for God was Dheyvatha. Five century was a long time, so I wouldn't worry about Arabisation of Dhivehi culture within the next 100 years.",5.0,0.0,2022-12-22 10:33:50 UTC,2.0,z80lives,zseqd9,t3_zseqd9,2162.0,FALSE,False,maldives,0.017837495,0.624141216,0.358021259,0.078617461,0.064819999,0.856562495,,,,nagative,neutral,,nagative

j1867ss,"Thanks for the reply. 

I'm not worried about the Arabisation. I do worry about the lack of self reflection,  critical thinking and tendency to be easily manipulated by superstition or propaganda among Maldivians today which I think are bigger problems. 

I didn't have the words for it for a long time but I sometimes feel like a guy whose never seen his reflection in a mirror when it comes to our cultural identity and history and I reckon many ordinary  Maldivians feel the same.",1.0,1.0,2022-12-22 11:11:47 UTC,0.0,thedrifter129,zseqd9,t1_j183e61,483.0,FALSE,True,maldives,0.010813263,0.947999418,0.041187249,0.017664241,0.670717001,0.311618745,0.00315542,0.925702095,0.07114251,nagative,negative,neutral,nagative

j1c5xs6,"So sorry that you and your wife had a bad experience here. I hope it is of some comfort that not all of us are assholes and in the fact that we do acknowledge the issues going on here. And I know a good many people who would, along with me, feel ashamed of the experience you had to go through. 

I lived in India for over 5 years when I was growing up and have had several different experiences ranging from good to horrifying.

j1iwua7,Komandoo is sooooo under rated. I try to tell people about it but they always go to bigger name resorts. Glad you had the same experience we did. We got a couples massage when we arrived on the island and it was a fantastic start. Would highly recommend that also. The sunset excursion was also fantastic.,4.0,0.0,2022-12-24 18:57:00 UTC,0.0,texaswelder_,ztsq9r,t3_ztsq9r,305.0,FALSE,False,maldives,0.983915865,0.002453455,0.01363066,0.868915737,0.00789015,0.123194113,0.91133976,0.002629243,0.086031064,positive,positive,positive,positive
j3rjgp1,"Maafushi is the most crowded and overrated local island. There are awesome ones like Omadhoo or Thoddoo, but,of course, not even those will give you the resort experience.
